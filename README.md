# Programming-Theory-Project
 A demonstration of practical Object-Orientated Programming in Unity. Each individual aspect 
 is covered in the wiki. The game itself demonstrating it is an extremely simple project 
 where you click on buttons to randomly change the color of a shape. 
 A live demo exists on [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-127048). 

## Getting Started

Clone the Github repo using ssh and open up the project in Unity. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

`
[Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
`

`
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
`

Download these and the run the installers. 

## Running the tests 

In Unity ; open up the Test Runner Window (Window > General > Test Runner). In the Window , 
make the PlayMode button get pressed in. Then it "Run all". 

### Break down into end to end tests

`
Color tests:  
  - Ensure that pentagon's image component color changes to match the internal color 
  - Ensure that triangle's image component color changes to match the internal color 
  - Ensure that square's image component color changes to match the internal color 
`


### And coding style tests

The Editorconfig dictates the style the code should be in. It is loosely 
based off of my research of the C# compiler's preferred options.
