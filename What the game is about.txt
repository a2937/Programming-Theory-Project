There's a storm coming and it's time to put all the 
farm animals back inside. They approach from the sides 
spooked from the storm. You have to gently lead them 
back inside by throwing safety blankets on them to get 
them to calm down. Then they'll go back inside where it's 
safe. And you take your little dog back inside your home when it's 
over.
